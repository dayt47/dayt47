### Hi

I am Oguz, a full-stack developer and automotive engineer from Berlin. I graduated from the Technical University of Berlin with a master's degree in automotive engineering. My programming experience began nearly 10 years ago with shell scripts, VBA, and later on, some C and Java. In the past year, I have shifted my focus to web development, working with technologies like React, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, SQL Databases, and MongoDB."

I worked with the following technologies: React, Typescript, Node, Express, Koa, PostgreSQL, MongoDB (Mongoose), Jest, Cypress, Python.
